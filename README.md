# Piccolo

Piccolo is one of a family of free, open-source RISC-V CPUs created by Bluespec, Inc.

- [Piccolo](https://github.com/bluespec/Piccolo): 3-stage, in-order pipeline
- [Flute](https://github.com/bluespec/Flute): 5-stage, in-order pipeline
- [Bassoon](https://github.com/bluespec/Bassoon): deep, out-of-order pipeline [Coming!]

Piccolo is intended for low-end applications (Embedded Systems, IoT, microcontrollers, etc.).

### About the source codes (in BSV and Verilog)

The BSV source code in this repository, from which the synthesizable
Verilog RTL in this repository is generated, is highly parameterized
to allow generating many possible configurations, some of which are
adequate to boot a Linux kernel.

The pre-generated synthesizable Verilog RTL source files in this
repository are for two specific configurations:

1. RV32IMU with 'M' extension (integer multiply/divide)
    - Privilege levels M (machine) and U (user)
    - Supports external, timer and software interrupts
    - Passes all riscv-isa tests for RV32IMU

2. RV64AIMSU with 'A' extension (atomic memory ops) and 'M' extension (integer multiply/divide)
    - Privilege levels M (machine), S (Supervisor) and U (user)
    - Supports external, timer and software interrupts
    - Sv32 and Sv39 Virtual Memory schemes
    - Passes all riscv-isa tests for RV64AIMSU
    - Boots the Linux kernel

If you want to generate other Verilog variants, you'll need a Bluespec
`bsc` compiler [Note: Bluespec, Inc. provides free licenses to
academia and for non-profit research].

The BSV source code supports:

- RV32I or RV64I
- Optional serial shifter (smaller hardware, slower) or barrel shifter (more HW, faster) for shift instructions
- Optional 'M' (integer multiply/divide)
- Optional 'A' (Atomic Memory Ops)
- Privilege M (machine), S (supervisor) and U (user)
- For privilege S, MMUs for Sv32 Virtual Memory for RV32 and Sv39 Virtual Memory for RV64
- AXI4-Lite Fabric interfaces, with optional 32-bit or 64-bit datapaths (independent of RV32/RV64 choice)
- and several other localized options

### Testbench included

This repository contains a simple testbench (a small SoC) with which
one can run RISC-V binaries in simulation by loading standard mem hex
files and executing in Bluespec's Bluesim, Verilator simulation or
iVerilog simulation.  The testbench contains an AXI4-Lite interconnect
fabric that connects the CPU to models of a boot ROM, a memory, a
timer and a UART for console I/O [Note: UART input is not currently
available using iverilog].

This repository contains six sample build directories, to build
RV32IMU or RV64AIMSU simulators, using Bluespec Bluesim simulation, a
Verilator Verilog simulation, or an Icarus Verilog ("iverilog")
simulation.

The generated Verilog is synthesizable. Bluespec tests all this code
regularly on Xilinx FPGAs.

#### Plans

- We will be adding the RISC-V 'C' option (compressed instructions). [Expected October 2018]
- We will be adding the RISC-V 'F' and 'D' options (single and double precision floating point). [Expected November 2018]
- Continuous micro-architectural improvements for performance and hardware area. [Ongoing]

----------------------------------------------------------------
## Source codes

This repository contains two levels of source code: Verilog and BSV.

**Verilog RTL** can be found in the following directories:

        builds/RV32IMU_verilator/Verilog_RTL/
        builds/RV32IMU_iverilog/Verilog_RTL/
        builds/RV64AIMSU_verilator/Verilog_RTL/
        builds/RV64AIMSU_iverilog/Verilog_RTL/

This is _synthesizable_ RTL (and hence acceptable to Verilator).  It
can be simulated in any Verilog simulator (we provide Makefiles to
build simulation executables for Verilator and for Icarus Verilog
(iverilog)).

The RTL represents RISC-V CPU RTL, plus a rudimentary surrounding SoC
enabling immediate simulation here, and which is rich enough to enable
booting a Linux kernel.  Users are free to use the CPU RTL in their
own Verilog system designs.  The top-level module for the CPU RTL is
`Verilog_RTL/mkBRVF_Core.v`.  The top-level module for the surrounding
SoC is `Verilog_RTL/mkTop_HW_Side.v`.  The SoC has an AXI4-Lite
fabric, a timer, a software-interrupt device, and a UART.  Additional
library RTL can be found in the directory `src_bsc_lib_RTL`.

**Bluespec BSV** source code (which was used to generate the Verilog RTL) can be found in:

- `src_Core/`, for the CPU core, with sub-directories:
   - `ISA/`:  generic types/constants/functions for the RISC-V ISA (not CPU-implementation-specific)
   - `RegFiles/`: generic register files for the GPRs (General-Purpose Registers) and CSRs (Control and Status Registers)
   - `Core/`: the CPU Core
   - `Near_Mem_VM/`: for the MMU and first-level cache.  In the CPU,
        this is instantiated twice to provide completely separate
        channels (MMU and Cache) for instructions and data.
   - `BSV_Additional_Libs/`: generic utilities (not CPU-specific)

- `src_Testbench/`, for the surrounding testbench, with sub-directories:

   - `Top/`: The system top-level (`Top_HW_Side.bsv`), a memory model
       that loads from a memory hex file, and some imported C
       functions for polled reads from the console tty (not currently
       available for Icarus Verilog).

   - `SoC/`: An interconnect, a boot ROM, a memory controller, a timer
       and software-interrupt device, and a UART for console tty I/O.

   - `Fabrics/`: Generic AXI4-Lite code for the SoC fabric.

The BSV source code has a rich set of parameters, mentioned above. The
provided RTL source has been generated from the BSV source
automatically using Bluespec's `bsc` compiler, with certain particular
sets of choices for the various parameters.  The generated RTL is not
parameterized.

To generate Verilog variants with other parameter choices, the user
will need Bluespec's `bsc` compiler.  See the `BSC_FLAGS` in following
Makefiles for examples of how the build is configured for different
ISA features:

        builds/Resources/Include_RV32IMU.mk
        builds/Resources/Include_RV64AIMSU.mk


In fact the CPU can also support a standard RISC-V Debug Module, and a
"Tandem Verifier" to check it for correctness on an
instruction-by-instruction basis.  Please contact Bluespec, Inc. if
you are interested in such variants.

----------------------------------------------------------------
### Building and running from the Verilog sources, out of the box

- In any of the following directories:

            builds/RV32IMU_verilator/
            builds/RV64AIMSU_verilator/
            builds/RV32IMU_iverilog/
            builds/RV64AIMSU_iverilog/

  - `$ make mkSim` will create a Verilog simulation executable using Verilator or iverilog, respectively

  - `$ make test` will run the executable on the standard RISC-V ISA
        test `rv32ui-p-add` or `rv64ui-p-add`, which is one of the
        tests in the `Tests/isa/` directory.  Examining the `test:`
        target in `Makefile`, we see that it first runs the program
        `Tests/elf_to_hex/elf_to_hex` on the `rv32ui-p-add` or
        `rv64ui-p-add` ELF file to create a `Mem.hex` file, and then
        runs the simulation executable which loads this `Mem.hex` file
        into its memory.

  - Following the pattern of `$ make test`, the user can run any of
    the other tests in the `Tests/isa/` directory by pointing at the
    chosen ELF file.

Note: an RV32IMU simulator will only successfully run ELF files
compiled for RV32IM, privilege U and M; running it on any other ELF
file will result in illegal instruction traps.  An RV64AIMSU simulator
will only successfully run ELF files compiled for RV64AIMSU, privilege
U, S and M; running it on any other ELF file will result in illegal
instruction traps.


#### Tool dependencies:

We test our builds with the following versions of iVerilog and
Verilator.  Later versions are probably ok; we have observed some
problems with earlier versions of both tools.

        $ iverilog -v
        Icarus Verilog version 10.1 (stable) ()

        $ verilator --version
        Verilator 3.922 2018-03-17 rev verilator_3_920-32-gdf3d1a4

----------------------------------------------------------------
### Running regressions of all standard RISC-V ISA tests

In the Tests/ directory there is a Python program using which you can
run the simulation executables (Bluesim, verilator or iverilog) on all
the relevant standard RISC-V ISA tests (a few hundred tests).  Please
see Tests/README.txt for more details.

----------------------------------------------------------------
### What you can build and run if you have Bluespec's `bsc` compiler

[Note: Bluespec, Inc. provides free licenses to academia and for non-profit research].

In either of the following directories:

        builds/RV32IMU_Bluesim
        builds/RV64AIMSU_Bluesim

  - `$ make compile link`

will compile and link a Bluesim executable.  Then,

  - `$ make test`

will run it on the `rv32ui-p-add` or `rv64ui-p-add` test.  This is one
of the tests in the `Tests/isa/` directory.  Examining the `test:`
target in `Makefile`, we see that it first runs the program
`Tests/elf_to_hex/elf_to_hex` on the `rv32ui-p-add` or `rv64ui-p-add`
ELF file to create a `Mem.hex` file, and then runs the simulation
executable which loads this `Mem.hex` file into its memory.

Following the pattern of `$ make test`, the user can run any of the
other tests in the `Tests/isa/` directory by pointing at the chosen
ELF file.

Note: an RV32IMU simulator will only successfully run ELF files
compiled for RV32IM, privilege U and M; running it on any other ELF
file will result in illegal instruction traps.  An RV64AIMSU simulator
will only successfully run ELF files compiled for RV64AIMSU, privilege
U, S and M; running it on any other ELF file will result in illegal
instruction traps.

You can also regenerate the Verilog RTL in the
`build/RV32IMU_verilator/`, `build/RV32IMU_iverilog/`
`build/RV64AIMSU_verilator/`or `build/RV64AIMSU_iverilog/`
directories.  Example:

  - `$ cd  builds/RV32IMU_verilator`
  - `$ make gen_RTL`

In each of the `builds/RV...` directories, you can edit the Makefile
to pass different flags and macros to `bsc` which will generate
different variants of the CPU as described above (RV32I/64I,
with/without M, with/without A, with/without privilege S and MMUs,
etc.)
